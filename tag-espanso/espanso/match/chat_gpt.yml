      Give me the definition of "{{form.name}}", its use cases (3), advantages, drawbacks, alternatives (if any), and sources. 

      Format your response using Markdown with these requirements:
      - headings start at level 2 (ie. `###`) 
      - the technical terms should be italicized
      - use inline code blocks with backticks (code) for inline code snippets
      - use multiline code blocks with triple backticks for multiline code snippets

      The heading (of level 2) should be "{{form.name}}".
      The remaining level 3 headings are "Use Cases", "Advantages", "Drawbacks", "Alternatives", and "Sources".

      Cite your references (with URLs when possible) in the "Sources" section.
